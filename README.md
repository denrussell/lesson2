I had challenges with this one particularly the second task "showdown". I had to do a lot of trial and errors. It took me about 3 days to figure it out.
I also had challenges with the "leap year" assignment. I had to figure out the order of if, elif and else because the order matters.
I had to make sure what goes with if is the right one and then it's like saying "otherwise" or "if not" then do this.
Overall the entire exercise was a lot of fun given the limited knowledge that I have so far.
I'm sure there's a lot more commands or formula to make it easier but I haven't learned them yet.
